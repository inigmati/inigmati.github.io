            <h4>Good bye, Blue sky!</h4>
            <h5>
                <br>Whenever I try to write something, I try to describe environment around me to give a reader feel
                <br>what is like to fill my shoes, or to give them feeling of reading the Proust's madeline or that
                <br>clip from the movie Sabrina where Audrey Hepburn is writing letter to her father from paris and
                <br>describing what is like to be midnight in paris while "someone is playing lovely La vie en rose".
                <br>Thus it is quite at night, Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture is playing, hearing intermittent vehicle 
                <br>noises in Mumbai whilst filling a mild gust of warmth on my skin. An year ago, when I was high on
                <br>weed I watched this animated sitcom "Rick and Morty". While the series was so goooood, I rememebered
                <br>hearing this song "Goodbye, Blue Sky" and I knew this song had the deeper meaning than the series
                <br>intended. Thus I searched.
                <br>Vióla! It has so much deeper than I thought. Roger Waters of Pink Floyd wrote this song based on
                <br>his childhood experiences of London bombing or Blitzkrieg during world war 2. When he sungs
                <br>"Goodbye blue sky" he is describing how he and his family had to run for the shelter underground
                <br> when germans were bombing the hell out of London. Clear skies are considered to be sacred in UK
                <br>british experiences brutal winter and seldom clear skies. Yet when the blitz were happening all over
                <br>the London, author would hide underground and miss the ever waiting days laden with sun light.
                <br>In next stanza, he sungs "did you ever wonder why we had to run for shelter when the promise of a
                <br>brave new world unfurled beneath the clear blue sky?" (obviously taking reference from Aldous Huxley's 
                <br>Brave new world). He ruminates about what the goverment of the day had promised and yet they were
                <br>foreced to run for the shelter.
                <br>Next stanza is about after war experience which were significantly influenced by trauma's of war.
                <br>"The flames are long gone but the pain lingers on". This line is not just poetic but heart-wrenching.
                <br>Obviously the war was short lived but the pain he would be experiencing is for lifetime.
                <br>I have this philosophy about pain and trauma which I have experienced first hand. Pain is something
                <br>that human can endure. Still, being a human, we feel the after-effect for long, even for lifelong.
                <br>I am not saying I am a weak person, hell! I used to assume I am the strongest one emotionally. Yet
                <br>when I experienced my first heart-break, I lived hell. I couldn't control my emotions. All I could
                <br>think was about her. She was the only person I had truly loved. And seeing that love going away from
                <br>you and breaking you up with thousand cuts, my heart just couldn't take it. I am still not recovered.
                <br>I still feel the pain everytime I remember her. It feels like sharpest metal ever created is cutting
                <br>my heart piece by piece without mercy. Dear reader, I don't want to bore with further details. All you
                <br>should know that I am still the same person who is capable to love someone unapolegitically and unconditionally,
                <br>even if my heart is crushed. I am building myself bit by bit. And one day, with right person, I can be
                <br>complete again.
                <br>The gist is, I listened this song and it has helped me recover if not completely. That people go through pain,
                <br>and can experience trauma of lifetime, yet they learn to live and learn to breath. And so I shall. There is
                <br>another song called "American Pie" by Don McLean that has helped me a lot. And I fucking love "The Smith". Wow!
                <br>Just wow! I am amazed by the lead singer's/lyricist's troubles in his life. Yet he put his agony through words.
                <br>Examples are abound about love and heart break. Yet I have reached at this junction. I don't hate people in loved
                <br>or being in love. I believe love frees you. Love brings out the best of you. I admire and same time jelous of people
                <br>who are in love. My friend who has recently got married, I am awe at him. Despite knowing that his partner will be no
                <br>longer with him after 3-4 years due her medical condition, yet he decided to stay by her. Love is kind, love is freeing,
                <br>love is asprining. Love makes you better person. Dear reader, if you are reading this, learn to love. Learn to be
                <br>yourself. Love teaches that. If you are in love, love makes you hear everything better. Suddenly songs have meaning,
                <br>people seems to be kind, world becomes more nicer place to you. Someone once said, if you are unhappy in love,
                <br>you burn the soufflè. And if you are happy in love, you forget to turn on the oven. It has happened with me. It
                <br>shall happen with you. Don't belive in life gets on even if you are not in love. Those people are lying. They have
                <br>they have never been in love. Love is entralling. Love is freeing. Love is your heart. Just love!
