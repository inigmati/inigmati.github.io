            <h4>Dear Radhika,</h4>
            <p>
                I first saw you on 15th January 2020. I remember you clearly. The moment I saw you I fell for you! I was clearly in love with you.
                <br><br>
                Yet, I was unable to confess you. How could I? after all, I was too afraid of the rejection. I was meant to have more conversation with you but couldn’t. Every time I tried to converse you, but always I got cold feet. During Dolly tai’s wedding I tried each n’ every way to talk to you but alas! No luck. Finally, I sent you request on Instagram. To my surprise, you not only accepted but followed me back. I made an idiotic excuse of falling for another girl to just chat to you! I know very bad move but at least we started the conversation.
                <br><br>
                After a while I realized that things aren’t moving, I just confessed to you that I like you on 6th January 2022 – almost after two years being fallen madly for you! You said neither yes nor no. A hope was still alive. We were still chatting. Those days, I used to wait anxiously for your text, stay up till 4AM waiting for your reply. I had repeatedly asked for a meeting, and you always denied. Finally, after feeling to pity myself for not getting I wanted, in frustration, I told you that I really like you and whether you feel same for me! You plainly said No and told to move on. It might have been very easy to you but not for me. I felt like someone pierced a spike through my heart. I was lamenting upon my fate. I couldn’t sleep for the week, felt down and frustrated.
                <br><br>
                I am writing you to let you know that I loved you deeply and asking you to reconsider. I know you don’t feel same for me, but I am just asking for one chance. Just one meet! I can’t promise you to be an ideal person, but I will feel you most loved and cared person. We can do so many romantic things. Explore so many wonders together that we just don’t know yet!
                <br><br>
                Ofcourse, you can always block me! But remember, one day we’ll be old, think about the stories we could have told!
            </p>
            <h4>Yours truly,</h4>
