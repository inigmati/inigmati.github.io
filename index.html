                        Whenever I try to write something, I try to describe the environment around me to give a reader the feel
                        of what it's like to fill my shoes, or to give them the feeling of reading Proust's madeleine or that
                        clip from the movie "Sabrina," where Audrey Hepburn is writing a letter to her father from Paris and
                        describing what it's like to be in Paris at midnight while "someone is playing lovely La Vie en Rose."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thus, it is quiet at night, Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture is playing, and I'm hearing intermittent vehicle 
                        noises in Mumbai whilst feeling a mild gust of warmth on my skin. A year ago, when I was high on
                        weed, I watched this animated sitcom "Rick and Morty." While the series was so good, I remembered
                        hearing the song "Goodbye, Blue Sky" and realized this song had a deeper meaning than the series
                        intended. So, I searched.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Voilà! It was much deeper than I thought. Roger Waters of Pink Floyd wrote this song based on
                        his childhood experiences of the London bombings or Blitzkrieg during World War II. When he sings
                        "Goodbye, blue sky," he describes how he and his family had to run for shelter underground
                        when the Germans were bombing the hell out of London. Clear skies are considered sacred in the UK;
                        the British experience brutal winters and seldom see clear skies. Yet, during the blitz across
                        London, the author hid underground, missing the ever-awaited days laden with sunlight.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the next stanza, he sings, "Did you ever wonder why we had to run for shelter when the promise of a
                        brave new world unfurled beneath the clear blue sky?" (obviously referencing Aldous Huxley's 
                        "Brave New World"). He ruminates on what the government of the day had promised, and yet they were
                        forced to run for shelter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next stanza is about the post-war experience, significantly influenced by the trauma of war.
                        "The flames are long gone, but the pain lingers on." This line is not just poetic but heart-wrenching.
                        While the war was short-lived, the pain he experienced was for a lifetime.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have this philosophy about pain and trauma, which I have experienced firsthand. Pain is something
                        that humans can endure. Still, being human, we feel the after-effects for a long time, even for a lifetime.
                        I am not saying I am a weak person—hell! I used to assume I was the strongest emotionally. Yet,
                        when I experienced my first heartbreak, I lived in hell. I couldn't control my emotions. All I could
                        think about was her. She was the only person I had truly loved. Seeing that love slip away and breaking
                        me with a thousand cuts, my heart just couldn't take it. I am still not recovered.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I still feel the pain every time I remember her. It feels like the sharpest metal ever created is cutting
                        my heart piece by piece without mercy. Dear reader, I don't want to bore you with further details. All you
                        should know is that I am still the same person who can love someone unapologetically and unconditionally,
                        even if my heart is crushed. I am building myself bit by bit. And one day, with the right person, I can be
                        complete again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The gist is, I listened to this song, and it has helped me recover—if not completely. People go through pain
                        and can experience lifelong trauma, yet they learn to live and breathe. And so I shall. There is
                        another song called "American Pie" by Don McLean that has helped me a lot. And I fucking love "The Smiths." Wow!
                        Just wow! I am amazed by the lead singer's/lyricist's troubles in his life. Yet, he put his agony into words.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Examples abound of love and heartbreak. Yet, I have reached this junction. I don't hate people in love
                        or the idea of being in love. I believe love frees you. Love brings out the best in you. I admire and, at the same
                        time, feel jealous of people who are in love. My friend, who has recently gotten married—I am in awe of him. 
                        Despite knowing that his partner will no longer be with him after 3-4 years due to her medical condition, yet he
                        decided to stay by her. Love is kind, love is freeing, love is inspiring. Love makes you a better person.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dear reader, if you are reading this, learn to love. Learn to be yourself. Love teaches that. If you are in love, 
                        love makes you hear everything better. Suddenly songs have meaning, people seem kind, and the world becomes a 
                        nicer place. Someone once said, "If you are unhappy in love, you burn the soufflé. And if you are happy in love, 
                        you forget to turn on the oven." It has happened to me. It shall happen to you. Don't believe in the saying 
                        "life goes on even if you are not in love." Those people are lying. They have never been in love. Love is 
                        enthralling. Love is freeing. Love is your heart. Just love!
                    </p>
